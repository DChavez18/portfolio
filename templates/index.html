    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129697286?s=96&v=4" alt="Profile Picture" width="200" height="200">
    <p>My name is Derek Chavez, and first and foremost, I am a devoted father of two incredible children: Kalaya, my 4-year-old daughter, and Dominic, the newest addition to our family. Currently, my wife, children, and I call Parker, CO our home.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I started my journey in the service industry, refining my communication and collaboration skills in roles such as training, serving, and bartending. I also gained experience as a handyman, focusing on bathroom and kitchen remodels as well as small exterior repairs, which emphasized the importance of craftsmanship and attention to detail.</p>
    <p>I have since transitioned into the field of software development. I relish the opportunities of acquiring fresh technological skills and applying my newfound knowledge to enhance the performance of my apps, uplift those in my surroundings, and elevate my own capabilities.</p>

    <h2>Professional Skills</h2>
    <p>Throughout my diverse career path, I have developed a strong ability to adapt to fast-paced environments and effectively communicate with others. I thrive in detail-oriented work and find great joy in collaborating within team-oriented settings. My ultimate aspiration is to forge a fulfilling career in the technology industryâ€”a field that ignites my passion and enables me to continually strive for personal growth and excellence.</p>
